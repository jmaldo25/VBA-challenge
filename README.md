# VBA Homework - The VBA of Wall Street


## Background

In this homework assignment I utilized VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

## Stock Market Analysis


## Instructions Given

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
	* The ticker symbol.
	
	* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
	* The total stock volume of the stock.
* Also have conditional formatting that highlighted positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

## Challenges

1. My solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

2. Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
